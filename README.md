# UFOs
### Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to create a website that would collate and display entries of UFO sightings based on date, city, state, country and shape. The website would also include some nice visuals as well as an article related to UFO sightings but would also include a filter that would allow the user to input specific filters that would filter out the table.

### Results
The new webpages search filter works so that if someone wanted to find the how many ufo sightings occured in their hometown on a certain date, we could easily sift through the data and display infomation that meets that criteria.

### Summary
One drawback would be needing to use specific dates. I think the filter would provide much more value if we could filter UFO's that appeared in LA in 1999, instead of a specific day.

* Find a way to show all dates within a year by using by grouping all dates with 1999 into one array

* Also could add a geomap to display where ufo sightings occured.
